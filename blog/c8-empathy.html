                    <h2>Try the 'Just Like Me' and 'Loving Kindness' practices. How did you feel?</h2>
                    <p>
                      I liked the excersise. It reminded me that everyone is just a person like me with problems, times of sadness and times of happiness and I wish everyone that I know was happy, even people I don't get along with. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Try the 'Traditional Practice of Loving Kindness' - Did you prefer this technique?</h2>
                    <p>
                      I found this must harder to get into. One thing that I did find interesting is that I got a much better feeling out of wishing happiness on to others than to myself.
                    </p>
                     <h2>Have you been in a situation in which Empathetic Listening could have improved a conversation? Or, describe a situation where empathetic listening practices worked well</h2>
                     <p>
                       I think any situation where listening is involved empathetic listening is good. It helps us to pay attention and to understand the context in which people are coming from. 
                     </p>
                     <h2>Give an example of "person praise" and "process praise"</h2>
                     <p>
                       Person praise is when you praise the person and tell them that they must be smart to be doing so well. This introduces the fact that the persons effort has not come into play, that they are naturally smart and therefore did well. This kind of praise doesn't help the person to work hard to improve. An example of this is 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                       Process praise is when you praise the person for how hard they must have worked to get to this point. This is important as it promotes a person to continue to try hard in everything they do to get the result they want. The result comes from their effort, not just because they are naturally smart.
