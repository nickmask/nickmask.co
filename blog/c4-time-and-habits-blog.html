<b>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try,</b>


<b>What did you find interesting?</b>


<b>What worked for you?</b>


<b>Which will you experiment further with?</b>
I think in future I will try the follow techniques:
- Ask youself 4 questions a day: In the morning "What are my goals?", "What are my challenges today?" and at the end of te day "Have I reached my goals today", "What have I learnt today?"
- The Pomodoro technique
- The Fogg method
- Getting in the zone training
