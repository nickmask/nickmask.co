        <p>
        <b>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try,</b>


        <b>What did you find interesting?</b>


        <b>What worked for you?</b>


        <b>Which will you experiment further with?</b>
        I think in future I will try the follow techniques:
        - Ask youself 4 questions a day: In the morning "What are my goals?", "What are my challenges today?" and at the end of te day "Have I reached my goals today", "What have I learnt today?"
        - The Pomodoro technique
        - The Fogg method
        - Getting in the zone training
