          <h2>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h2>
          <p>What Shereef is talking about is exactly how I am treating this course. Some people ask me "Oh, so do you get a qualification or a certificate in something?" and I say "I don't actually know, but it is irrelevant. This course is about learning and giving my all and coming learning skills. My outcome is the skills I learnt, not a qualification.". To me this means I am giving this course my all to soak up and to learn as much as possible, but also make friends and have fun!</p>
          <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
          <p>My impressions so far are really good. I love coming to the EDA offices each day and leave with a smile on my face. People here are more than happy to help when you are confused and chat when you are in the kitchen. I am loving my experience.</p>
          <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
          <p>By being present, helping when I have knowledge that others don't and giving it my all in everything I do.</p>
          <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
          <p>No, I came into EDA with high expectionation and a ready to go attitude and that hasn't changed. If anything, I am even more energised to work hard and make this an amazing experience for myself and my pairs.</p>
          <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
          <p>This is the kind of enviroment I excell in, so I am really excited. It does not make me nervous, it makes me excited.</p>
