<b>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</b>
What Shereef is talking about is exactly how I am treating this course. Some people ask me "Oh, so do you get a qualification or a certificate in something?" and I say "I don't actually know, but it is irrelevant. This course is about learning and giving my all and coming learning skills. My outcome is the skills I learnt, not a qualification.". To me this means I am giving this course my all to soak up and to learn as much as possible, but also make friends and have fun! 

<b>What are your impressions?</b>
My impressions so far are really good. I love coming to the EDA offices each day and leave with a smile on my face. People here are more than happy to help when you are confused and chat when you are in the kitchen. I am loving my experience. 

<b>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</b>
By being present, helping when I have knowledge that others don't and giving it my all in everything I do.

<b>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</b>
No, I came into EDA with high expectionation and a ready to go attitude and that hasn't changed. If anything, I am even more energised to work hard and make this an amazing experience for myself and my pairs.

<b>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?<b>
This is the kind of enviroment I excell in, so I am really excited. It does not make me nervous, it makes me excited.
