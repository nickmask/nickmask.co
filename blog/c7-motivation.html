                    <h2>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h2>
                    <p>
                      The reason I am doing this course is because althought I liked my last job, and liked the people I worked with, I wasn't doing something I was passionate about and felt fulfilled my purpose. For me there are a couple of things that make me passionate and make me feel like I have purpose and it kind of comes down to 1) People and 2) Tech :D.
                    <p>
                        Tech is something I have always loved, read about, experimented with and got. Ever since building PCs when I was 13 I have been obsessed. Every workplace I have been in I have because the tech experience or interim IT guy. Me and technology just seem to get each other. So for me, working in the tech space is a passion and something that I won't stop until I do.
                    <p>
                      People are also really important to me. I have found over the years that my motivation comes from working with others. I feel it is really important that I work with a team of people who also love what they do. I also love helping others make their lives easier and feel that working at a tech company that did that would give me a lot of purpose. We will see!
                    </p>
                    </p>
                    </p>
                    <h2>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</h2>
                    <h3>What are your core values?</h3>
                    <p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Friendship</li>
                        <li>Teamwork</li>
                        <li>Challenges</li>
                        <li>Honesty and trust</li>
                        <li>Work/life balance</li>
                        <li>Open minded</li>
                        <li>Optimism</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>What do you stand for?</h3>
                    <p>
                      I stand for being open and honest with people, taking people for who they are and trying to not be judgemental of anybody. I want to stand up for what is right, and have a happy enjoyable life.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Really good. I understand where they are coming from with resilience. I know I need to get a better handel on my emotions, whether that is anxiety or at times stress. Over the last few years I have improve a lot on those things.
