          <h2>Did you connect with any of the analogies for the mind</h2> 
          <p>I found the analogy of the fluttering flag in the wind resonated with me. The flag being our mind, the pole representing mindfulness with its ability to keep the mind stead and grounded dispite all emotional movement.</p>
          <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2> 
          <p>I liked the part on self-confidence. I have never had particularly high self-confidence but I have experienced the boost you get from going to a motivational speech or seminar. But Ming is right, that monitvation never lasts. I have been trying more and more to understand exactly why my self-confidence gets low, because then I can rationally explain it to my mind and not worry about it. The understand does help build self confidence.</p>
          <h2>How did you find the body scanning?</h2>
          <p>It was good! Very relaxing to the point of tiredness but it was a really interesting experience. I actually noticed things I thought I wouldn't. </p>
