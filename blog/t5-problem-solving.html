                    <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you</h2>
                    <p>
                      1. Got blocked on a simple problem
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      2. Solved a problem in an elegant way
                      In both cases:    
                    </p>
                    <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
                    <p>
                      When I was building my website I wanted to use what is called a "sprite" to make the links change color when hovering over them. The way to think of a sprite is instead of having 2 images, one blue and one white and when you hover the white one shows, you just have one image which has both those images on them but you only display one at a time. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
                    <p>
                      I first decided that I didn't actually want to completely learn what sprites were, I just wanted to get a piece of code that worked. So I spent a whole morning trying to find a piece of code i could jerry rig into solving my problem with the result of a wasted morning. I decided then that I was just going to learn the concept and that changed my problem solving technique. I start searching "How sprites work" and "CSS sprite how-to".
                    </p>
                    <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
                    <p>
                      In the morning I felt really frustrated, I just couldn't work it out. I just wanted to make it work and nothing was working for me. Only when I took a step back and said "This is stupid doing it like this", did I actually start to enjoy the process of implenting a sprite.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What did you learn? </h3>
                    <p>
                      I learnt a lot actually. I realised that often when you work to just find a piece of code that you can drop in, change only small bits a pieces, you often spend more time. Often it is better to put your energy into learning HOW something works and then implementing it that way.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
                    <h3>Psuedocode</h3>
                    <p>
                      I actually feel i should be doing more psuedocode. It will help me understand the problem I am trying to solve and how I would solve that with my Javascript knowledge
                    </p>
                    <h3>Trying something</h3>
                    <p>
                      I am getting better. I am good at trying things in HTML and CSS and feel really confident, but when I go into JavaScript it gets harder, which is to be expected. I can kinda of just try things but not at a really good level. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
                    <p>
                      It has helped me more than once just talking myself through a problem. I noticed it the most when I started asking someone for help, and just the act of asking for help and explaining my problem solved my problem.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
                    <p>
                      Getting better. At first I would just go "WTF, why isn't this running", but now I am taking a more logical approach and checking for error messages in the console before screaming at my laptop
                    </p>
                    <h3>Console.logging</h3>
                    <p>
                      I think I could improve a lot. I know how to do it, but am not confident enough in my coding to use it really well.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Googling</h3>
                    <p>
                      I would consider myself an A+ googler. Google always has the answer.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
                    <p>
                      I try and often ask my peers if I am really stuck, chances are that one of them will be able to help.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
                    <p>
                      I less often ask the coaches in phase-0. I imagine that will change when we start bootcamp.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                      Getting better. I know how important reflection is to learning, so I am trying hard to be very serious with my reflection.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</h2>
                    <h3>.map()</h3>
                    <p>
                      In Javascript we have arrays, which is a "list" of different values, this could be names, dates, or just numbers. Let's say we have a list of numbers which would be written as var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]. What we can do with .map() is set map to do something to each of the numbers in the array. Say it was a list of "points" that people had and we wanted to award everyone an additional 10 points, regardless of how many points they currently had. We could use .map() to go through the array and add 10 to each number and then return us the array with the changes made. This would be done like so:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      var newPoints = points.map(function(point) {return point + 10)};
                    </p>
                    <h3>.filter()</h3>
                    <p>
                      .filter() is similar to map in many ways, it also runs through each item in an array. However, instead of returning me an array with a function performed to it, it returns a new array of items that have passed a test. For example, maybe now I want to only see people who have greater than 15 points. I could write this as:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      var above15 = newPoints.filter(function(point) return point > 15)};
                    </p>
                    <h3>.reduce()</h3>
                    <p>
                      Map and filter are what we can call "list transformers", and perform a pretty specifc task. They turn your list into something else. Reduce can be used to express ANY list transformation function. Reduce takes a function, like map and filter, but also needs an object (lets call that a starting place). An example of how we can use reduce is that we can use it to add all the items in your list together. Each time it does a "loop" it takes the first value, stores it and then we it goes to the second value it adds the first to that and so on. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Recursion</h3>
                    <p>
                      Recursion is a complex thing to understand. The best way I can describe it is it when 2 functions are calling on each other, until a factor is false and then they stop. each time it runs it is reliant on the past time it ran until it gets to a "termination condition" or "base case", where it stops. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This can be particularly useful for factorials (multiplying a number by each of its factors). So, how would a program do this?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We would have one function that took the number "x" and mupliplied it by "y" (starting at the number "x"), we would then have another function that took y and  minused 1 as long as y wasn't 0 (the termination condition) and passed y back to the first function, which would run again and pass back to the second function, all the way down to 0, and BINGO that is recursion. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      function factorial(n) {<br>
                          if (n === 0) {<br>
                            return 1;<br>
                          }<br>
                          <br>
                          // This is it! Recursion!!<br>
                          return n * factorial(n - 1);<br>
                        }<br>
                        <br>
                        factorial(10)
                    </p>
