        <p>I am a massive geek that loves to eat and cook food, travel around the globe, play games and follow the latest tech. 

        <p>Originally from Jafa-ville, New Zealand, I moved down to the windy city of Wellington in October. I quickly found out about EDA and signed my ass up for some first class learning </p>

<p>In my spare time you will kind me thrashing some computer games, trying to find somewhere to fish, or if I am really lucky, traveling around the globe.</p>

<p>It is awesome to be here studying at EDA and I can't wait to start boot-camp. I am happy to help out anyone who is stuck where ever I can! Can't wait to meet all of you come Feb!</p>
